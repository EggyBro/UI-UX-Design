Premise:
This project was one of the first UI/UX design projects I undertook.
The prototype was built in AdobeXD. 

Execution:
As per the assignment brief, the first stage of the project was doing research
into a problem that needed to be solved. At the time the SGBuses app had not been
integrated with SMRT services so having an app that would integrate both bus and 
train services made sense. 

Once the app idea was firmed up, I then moved to market research by creating a user
persona as well as conducting market analysis.

Reflections:
Currently, there are multiple apps created by both third parties and by the 
transport authorities which sport the features that this app proposal had. Even going
further to add more features such as remote top-up of ez-link cards and so on. In that
sense this app happened to be slightly ahead of the curve. However, while the core
concept was sound, it definitely lacked sufficient market analysis as I only conducted
research into a very narrow user band. 

These days, almost everyone uses mobile apps from children to the elderly. On top of
that, almost everyone also uses public transportation. As such if I were to 
improve on this project, I would do so by considering a wider context and conducting 
more comprehensive market research and considering more user personas.
