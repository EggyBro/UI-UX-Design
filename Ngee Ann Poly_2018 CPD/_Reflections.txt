Premise:
The CPD group project was a trimseter long assignment where we had to ideate, plan and develop
an application for use by the youth of Singapore. 

Execution:
Initially, our application had a significantly larger scope, aiming to use cameras and AI to
detect crowd sizes so that we would be able to help users decide which food court would be 
the best to go to for their meals. Unfortunately the plan fell through as we were unable to
secure the funding necessary for the cameras and we were also unable to get the API for the 
crowd detection AI. In the end we had to scope down to what was essentially a food ordering app.

The production bible details the process of development fairly comprehensively in this case
we did have the foresight to also account for faculty and staff members who might also have
a reason to use the app as they are also likely going to eat at school canteens.

Partway through development we also reworked the colour scheme of the UI.

Reflections:
Looking back at the design of the app, its appearance and visuals are definitely dated. The
overall layout of the buttons, the choice of colours and the user flow are all quite flawed.
On top of that, the registration and login page requires the user to key in information which
by all rights is quite unnecessary for the app's function.

The home screen also lacks a true call to action and the relevant information which we wish
to provide users with is also not readily available without navigating through several steps.

For that reason, significant improvements can definitely be made to the app to make it more user
friendly and intuitive as well as more accessible for any user, not limited to students or staff.
