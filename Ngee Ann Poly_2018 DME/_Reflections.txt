Premise:
This group project was a mobile development assignment which required us to build an app to
promote tourism in Singapore. Because Pokemon GO was quite popular at the time, we decided to
make something similar to it but users would collect 3d models of tourist attractions instead.

Execution:
For this project, I was mainly involved in the planning phase and the making of 3d models for
use in the app. The market research we conducted was cursory and we only accounted for the
official government released Singapore Travel Guide App. We had also planned for the app to
be scalable to include other countries in the future should further collaboration be done.

Reflections:
This project was beset by time constraints as it was assigned during the second half of the
semester, in between two other major group projects. because of this, a lot of the planning,
research and implementation was truncated.

If I were to improve on this app, the first thing I would do is consider expanding the competitor
analysis to include other travel apps as well as travel blogs and hotel booking sites.

In the current day and age, having an app that only does one thing is not very desirable so the
app in its finalised state would be completely outdated. Another point of note is that while
this app was made to fill a requirement, it does not solve any problem in parrticular when it
comes to travelling and tourism within Singapore. In that sense, having an app that actually
solves an existing problem would make it significantly more marketable.
