Premise:
The objective of this project was to create a shop menu for a game developed for the SNES platform.
The constraints were that we needed four item categories and different classes, as well as shop
items which were locked to each specific class.

Execution:
The initial planning phase was done on Figma using temporary assets given to us. The prototype can
be seen in the TDP PT2 document. 

From there, the final product was developed in unity as can be seen in the TDP PT3 document and file.

Reflections:
The constraint of this project was that we were developing a shop with keybinds for a specific
console controller. If I were to improve on it with considerations to the existing constraints,
I would have implemented the feedback given by the playtest report.

I would also have provided more feedback for every action taken. Things like sound cues for 
selecting and purchasing or selling items and animated feedback showing the amount being subtracted 
from the player's wallet.
