Premise:
This group project was a VR game development assignment where we were asked to create an immersive
Virtual Reality game.

Execution:
During the planning phase, it was made clear to us that the key grading factor was immersion.
For that reason, I pushed for the app to have minimal use of heads up display elements. The challenge
then became the question of how to guide players without the use of a heads up display or non-organic
prompts.

The method I chose was through the implementation of an audio tutorial which would guide users and 
provide feedback for their actions. This served as their primary source of feedback aside from the 
other floating elements such as the text guide and the scoreboard.

The placement of the guides was decided such that they were easy to view but would not obstruct the 
player's immersion once they began playing.

Reflections:
The placement of the floating elements could be better implemented such as the guide and the scoreboard
to be more conducive for immersion. One way to go about it would be to place them on signboards as
a part of the level itself rather than just floating beside the player.
