Premise:
For this group project, we were tasked with planning and developing a mobile app which was capable
of scheduling events and ordering items for a judo CCA. The app would be used by students, staff
members of the school, and children of the staff members.

Execution:
The assignment report details our planning and development phase fairly well, documenting our user
analysis as well as task and domain analyses. We used google slides to create our low fidelity
prototype as we were operating on some rather tight time constraints at the time. 

For our final implementation in figma, we were also limited by time and as such had to refer to
a template for developing our application.

Reflections:
Our development was quite rushed and as such, some features did not get smoothed out as well as
we would have liked. For example, signing in to the app could be better done using biometric login.

Additionally, the main menu does lack a call to action. An improvement to implement would be to
have the book session button be highlighted when the user first logs in. This would help guide 
them in the direction of what they should do as a first time user. 

Another improvement to make would be a set of highlights on the calendar to better show users
which days have available training slots that they can book.
